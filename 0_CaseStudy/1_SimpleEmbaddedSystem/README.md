# 1)About the calculator

## i.Description About Calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Some also do square roots, and more complex calculators can help with calculus and draw function graphs. Calculators are found everywhere.

## ii.Identifying Features

* calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers.
* The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions.

# 4) Details about the components

## 1)Keyboard:
              Used by the user to give their Inputs to the microcontroller.              
## 2)PowerSupply:
              Provides the power required for the system.    
## 3)Microcontroller:
              It will take the inpus from the Keyboard and proceess them and then sends the output.
## 4)Display:
              The main function of the display is to show the output to the user.
              
# 5)SWOT Analysis
